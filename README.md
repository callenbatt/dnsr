# DNSR

DNSr is a DNS utility that retrieves DNS records associated with a specified hostname. It allows users to perform parallel queries against major resolvers using DNS over HTTPS, facilitating the retrieval of A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and CAA records. DNSr also conducts server-side queries against authoritative nameservers, providing a means to verify updates and identify discrepancies between resolvers and authoritative sources.

This app was developed in pure vanilla everything, built with vite, deployed with vercel.
